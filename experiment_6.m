% aim: The aim of this problem is to design a low-pass digital Butterworth filter 
% with specific passband and stopband requirements, analyze its properties, and 
% compare its responses.
% 
% Procedure: the filter specifications, including passband ripple, cutoff frequency, 
% and stopband edge frequency, were defined. The Butterworth filter order was 
% calculated using the MATLAB's built-in function 'butterord'. A low-pass Butterworth 
% filter was designed using the 'butter' function. A pole-zero plot was created 
% to assess filter stability and visualize poles and zeros. Additionally, a Bode 
% plot was generated to visualize the frequency response, and the impulse and 
% step responses of the filter were calculated and compared to understand its 
% time-domain behavior.    (--------------stable or not?)
% 
% results: The transfer function represents the mathematical description of 
% the filter's behavior. The pole-zero plot helps assess filter stability; poles 
% should be inside the unit circle for stability. The Bode plot illustrates the 
% frequency response characteristics, including cutoff frequency and rolloff rate. 
% 
% The impulse and step responses show how the filter responds to input signals, 
% revealing transient behavior and steady-state characteristics. The impulse response 
% represents how the filter responds to a sudden input change. In this case, it 
% starts with a spike (due to the sudden change) and then gradually decays. The 
% filter's characteristics, such as its order and cutoff frequency, determine

% Question 2 
% 
% The aim of this problem is to filter ECG (Electrocardiogram) data using a 
% Butterworth filter with a specified sampling frequency and then visualize and 
% compare the filtered output with the original signal.
% 
% Procedure: The ECG data stored in the text file was used and filtered with 
% a Butterworth filter, considering a sampling frequency of 720 Hz. The assessment 
% of how the filter affected the original ECG signal, particularly in terms of 
% noise reduction and signal preservation is done.
% 
% Results: The filtered ECG signal shows a reduction in high-frequency noise 
% or baseline drift, resulting in a smoother and cleaner signal. The plot shown 
% below is based on a filter order of 5 and cutoff frequency taken as 5 Hz. There 
% is a trade-off between noise reduction and signal distortion. Higher filter 
% orders provide better noise reduction but could lead to signal distortion when 
% too high. 

% Load the audio signal

% Find the dominant frequency (fundamental) in the spectrogram

% Design a Butterworth band-pass filter centered around the fundamental frequency

[b, a] = butter(6, [(fundamental_freq - bandwidth/2) (fundamental_freq + bandwidth/2)] / (fs/2), 'bandpass');

% Aim: The aim is to analyze an audio signal by computing its spectrogram, designing 
% a Butterworth band-pass and verifying through spectrogram that only the fundamental 
% frequency is retained in the filtered output. 
% 
% Procedure:  the spectrogram of the 'instru3.wav' audio file was plotted using 
% the hamming window function. A digital Butterworth band-pass filter was designed 
% to extract the fundamental frequency while removing other frequency components, 
% including DC. The filtered audio was saved as a new WAV file. This process involved 
% analyzing the original spectrogram to identify the fundamental frequency as 
% the first major peak after DC. The aim was to isolate and preserve the fundamental 
% frequency while eliminating unwanted components.
% 
% 
% 
% Observations: 
% 
% The original spectrogram of the audio signal reveals the frequency content 
% and any harmonic components present in the signal. The fundamental frequency 
% refers to the first significant peak in the spectrogram after DC, and it corresponds 
% to the main pitch or tone of the audio signal.
% 
% The filtered audio showcases the clarity of the isolated fundamental frequency 
% and the removal of other frequencies. The spectrogram of the filtered audio 
% shown below confirms that only the fundamental frequency remains, while other 
% frequency components have been attenuated or removed.

% Question 4 
% 
% Aim: The aim of this problem is to design a Type I Chebyshev filter with low-pass 
% characteristics, compare it to a Butterworth filter, and evaluate their responses.
% 
% Procedure:  The Chebyshev Type I filter order was computed using the 'cheb1ord' 
% function, and the Butterworth filter order was calculated using the 'butterord' 
% function. Both Chebyshev Type I and Butterworth low-pass filters were designed 
% using the determined filter orders and specifications. Bode plots were created 
% for both filters to compare their frequency responses. Impulse and step responses 
% of both filters were calculated and compared to assess their time-domain behavior. 
% 
% Results: 
% 
% The Chebyshev Type I filter oder is 5 and that of the Butterworth filter is 
% 8. Chebyshev filter has a lower order for the same specifications. The difference 
% in filter orders arises from the filter type and the trade-offs between passband 
% ripple and stopband attenuation:
% 
% Chebyshev Type I filters can achieve a steeper roll-off and lower filter order 
% while tolerating some passband ripple (3 dB in this case).
% 
% Butterworth filters have a smoother frequency response but require a higher 
% filter order to meet the same specifications in terms of passband ripple and 
% stopband attenuation.
% 
% 
% 
% The Bode plot comparison showcases the differences in frequency response, 
% including filter rolloff and passband characteristics. 
%% 
% # Chebyshev Type I Filter (Red Plot):
%% 
% The Bode plot for the Chebyshev Type I filter shows a characteristic response 
% with ripples in the passband, as indicated. The passband ripple (maximum variation 
% in gain) is within the specified limits, resulting in a peak-to-peak variation 
% of approximately 3 dB around the cutoff frequency. The filter exhibits a steeper 
% roll-off in the stopband, reaching the desired stopband attenuation of 40 dB.
%% 
% # Butterworth Filter (Blue Plot):
%% 
% The Bode plot for the Butterworth filter appears smoother without the passband 
% ripples, as indicated by the blue plot. It achieves the desired attenuation 
% in the stopband but with a gentler roll-off compared to the Chebyshev Type I 
% filter. The filter order for Butterworth is higher (8) compared to Chebyshev 
% Type I (5), reflecting the trade-off between filter order and passband ripple.
% 
% 
% 
% Comparing the impulse and step responses helps evaluate the filters' transient 
% and steady-state behaviors. Chebyshev filters provide steeper rolloff and less 
% attenuation in the passband compared to Butterworth filters but at the expense 
% of ripple in the passband. (more on this -----)

% Define filter specifications based on Problem 1
alpha = 1 + mod(235, 3); % Passband ripple in dB
fc = 10;                 % Cutoff frequency in Hz
fstop = 20;              % Stopband edge frequency in Hz
Fs = 720;                % Sampling frequency in Hz

% Calculate filter order using cheb1ord for Chebyshev Type I
[Rp, Rs] = deal(alpha, 40); % Passband ripple and stopband attenuation in dB
[N_chebyshev, Ws] = cheb1ord(2*pi*fc/Fs, 2*pi*fstop/Fs, Rp, Rs, 's');

% Calculate filter order using butterord for Butterworth
