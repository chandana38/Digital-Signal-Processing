% results: 
%% 
% # For the first 120 samples of the signal, the DFT plot shows a peak at the 
% specified frequency (30 Hz) with a magnitude of 60, as expected for a unit amplitude 
% sinusoid. 
% # For the first 130 samples, it exhibits a peak at the same frequency. The 
% magnitude is now distributed across multiple frequency bins. This indicates 
% a reduction in frequency resolution. 
% # To match the DFT of the first 120 samples with a different sample size (N 
% â‰  120), we find that N = 240 would produce an identical DFT. This is because, 
% the DFT is periodic with period N, and doubling the sample size aligns it with 
% the original.

% 2. aim: This problem aims at demonstarating the impact of sample size on frequency 
% resolution and spectral leakage. 
% 
% 
% 
% results: The DFT of the signal with 215 samples results in limited information 
% on frequency components. The main lobe of the DFT is broad which makes it harder 
% to distinguish between closely spaced frequency components. The frequency components 
% present in the signal may not be accurately resolved. 
% 
% On the other hand, the DFT with 1915 samples provides the highest frequency 
% resolution in this analysis. The main lobe is narrow and accurate detection 
% detection of closely spaced frequency components is possible and the spectral 
% leakage is minimal. 
% 
% in conclusion, Increasing the sample size in the DFT analysis results in better 
% frequency resolution and reduced spectral leakage. Smaller sample sizes result 
% in broader main lobes, limiting the ability to distinguish closely spaced frequency 
% components.The choice of sample size is critical for accurate spectral analysis, 
% and a larger N provides more detailed frequency information.

% 3. results: In Problem 2, without windowing, we observe broader main lobes 
% and pronounced side lobes in the DFT indicating spectral leakage. This hinders 
% the precise identification of frequency components. However, in Problem 3, the 
% Hanning window reduces spectral leakage, resulting in narrower main lobes and 
% diminished side lobes. This enhances the frequency resolution and allows accurate 
% localization and separation of closely spaced frequency components. 
%

% 4. aim: This problem aims at highlighting the impact of windowing and zero-padding 
% techniques on the accuracy of estimating dominant frequencies within a signal. 
% 
% results: The Hamming window is applied to the signal to eliminate spectral 
% leakage and improve frequency resolution. Zero-padding is used to increase the 
% number of samples for better frequency interpolation. The two dominant frequency 
% components in the signal are identified from the DFT, expressed in terms of 
% Fs given as 0.026Fs (26 Hz) and 0.074Fs (74 Hz)
% 
% The choice of windowing technique  impacts the accuracy and resolution of 
% frequency component estimation. The Hamming window, by reducing spectral leakage, 
% provides more precise frequency localization and reduces side lobes in the DFT, 
% making it effective for analyzing signals. The rectangular window, which has 
% no windowing, is simpler but can result in a broader main lobe and increased 
% spectral leakage.
